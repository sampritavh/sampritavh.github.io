Hi, this is Samprita Hegde. I have about 14 years of experience in Software Development and IT. From past 7 years my focus has been in DevOps and Cloud Computing. I am deeply passionate about architecting ,designing and implementing solutions in cloud.

This site is to write about experiences while working with cloud. Understand the caveats and talk about how to get around them.
